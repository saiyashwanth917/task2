This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to gain insights into passenger survival patterns. Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is first cleaned by handling missing values and encoding categorical features. Statistical summaries such as mean, median, and standard deviation are generated to understand the distribution of numerical data. Various visualizations, including histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, pairplots, and countplots, are used to reveal relationships between features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and port of embarkation in relation to survival outcomes. The analysis shows that females, first-class passengers, and those who paid higher fares had higher chances of survival. This EDA process helps identify trends, outliers, and correlations, providing a solid foundation for future machine learning or predictive modeling tasks.
